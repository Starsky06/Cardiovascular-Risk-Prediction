HELLO GUYS ^_^

This is the part of training machine learning models, and I have training 3 types of difference traning model algorithrm to perform it 
The objective of this assignment is to train machine learning models that can accurately predict the cardiovascular risk (low, medium, high) of an individual.
Using the information provided in the “dataset.csv” dataset. The results can be helpful for cardiovascular disease diagnosis and prevention.
The purpose of the assignment is to let students have hands-on experience solving real-world problems using machine learning techniques. 
We will learn to perform data exploration, pre-processing, model selection, model training, and tuning of the learning algorithm in order to achieve better prediction accuracy.

If have any problem, welcome to correct me ya 
Thanks
